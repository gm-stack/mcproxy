Stuff to implement

-- Intercept map chunks, draw a map for the client
-- Intercept / send "set inventory / get inventory" packets
-- Intercept time packets, modify to client (always daytime)
-- Find other clients
-- display your position, support "GPS" waypoints
-- teleport to areas / other clients regardless of server support
-- build blocks in other spots (is this possible?)
-- instant mining
-- clear area around
-- insert fences around other players
